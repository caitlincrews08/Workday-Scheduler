# Workday-Scheduler

## Link
Here's the link to my [Workday_Scheduler](https://caitlincrews08.github.io/Workday-Scheduler/).

## Description
This website was developed as part of my week 5 homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida. The website consits of an agenda with text areas to pencil in appointments.

When the website deploys, the date appears towards the top of the screen. Below that, there are blocks of time labelled by hour. The blocks are color coded to reflect appointments in the past (gray), the present hour (red), and future time blocks (green). To schedule an appointment, the user can type in the text area then press the save button to save the appointment in local storage. When the page is refreshed, saved appointments stay in their slots. The entire day wipes clear at the start of a new day.
